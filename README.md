## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd studybase
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

### Available Scripts
- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm eject`: Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## 🔐 Authentication Integration

The application is ready for backend integration with placeholder functions:

```javascript
// In App.js - Replace these with actual API calls
const handleLogin = () => {
  // Your login logic here
};

const handleSignUp = () => {
  // Your signup logic here
};

const handleLogout = () => {
  // Your logout logic here
};
```

### Testing Authentication
To test the authentication flow, uncomment these lines in `App.js`:
```javascript
// setIsAuthenticated(true);
// localStorage.setItem('isAuthenticated', 'true');
```

## 🎯 Significant Development Prompts

This project was shaped by several key requirements and design decisions:

### **1. Initial Project Setup**
> "Create a React.js project styled with CSS (use JavaScript, not TypeScript).
Build the main page with a navbar containing the links Home, New Base, My Bases, and Chat, centered in the navbar. On the left, display the project name StudyBase, and on the right, include a profile icon linking to the user account and a light/dark theme toggle switch."

### **2. Theme Design Requirements**
> "Use the two provided images as the light and dark mode themes, respectively. Design the webpage in a unique, futuristic style."

### **3. Light Theme Refinement**
> "Update the light mode to be more white-dominant with blue as the secondary color. Fix the navbar layout and redesign the Hero Visual section for better presentation."

### **4. Responsive Design**
> "Make the whole website responsive, handle the navbar in mobile view."

### **5. Content and Styling Updates**
> "Apply glassmorphism to cards in light theme.
Ensure all paragraphs are justified throughout the project, including future edits. Add the following line below the main card and floating elements: “Start by creating your first Base and see how simple and satisfying studying can be when everything you need is right in front of you.” Set the dark theme as the default."

### **6. Text Visibility Enhancement**
> "Make the para text in light theme black to increase visibility."

### **7. Authentication System**
> "According to the user status(whether the user is logged in or not, the navbar should change). If logged in it should show the profile icon. If not logged in there should be two buttons, to the right of the theme toggle: 'Log In' and 'Sign Up'. The backend logic, user authentication logics will be provided later, just create it and it will be tested after backend integration."

### **8. Mobile Authentication Enhancement**
> "In mobile view, between the toggle and hamburger icon, there should be a profile icon and when hovered or clicked on it, the signup and login buttons must appear. THIS IS ONLY FOR Mobile view or wherever the Hamburger menu is used."

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Connect authentication with actual API
- **Routing**: Implement React Router for navigation
- **User Dashboard**: Create user-specific pages
- **Study Base Management**: Implement CRUD operations
- **Real-time Chat**: Add WebSocket integration
- **File Upload**: Support for study materials
- **Progress Tracking**: Analytics and progress visualization
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user study sessions
